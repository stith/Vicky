Vicky was NoBullcraft's IRC bot. She handled automatically moderating our IRC
channel, as well as bridging the IRC-to-minecraft gap to let people in IRC see
who was online in-game.

Note that some features might not work, as Vicky has been neglected for an
entire major Minecraft version. This code is just provided as a reference for
people who might be curious about how our little helper worked internally.

Requirements
------------

- Ruby v1.9.2
- [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch) v2.0.4

And a few other gems, which I'm sure the error messages will alert you to.
